# LarvaSpawn

## Welcome to your new Daemon.

There's a few things you need to do:

- If you're using the SDK:
  - Uncomment the lines in the `Gemfile` and `test/test_helper.rb`
  - Rename `config/meducation-sdk.yml.optional` to `config/meducation-sdk.yml`
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `bundle exec rake test`
- Add your keys to `config/*`
